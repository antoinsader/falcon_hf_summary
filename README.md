# Obsidian LLM summary Plugin

This is an LLM summarizer plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It is my first time to create a plugin so the plugin is so simple until now.

It is using Hugging Face, Falconsai, text_summarization model to summarize your notes.

I am planning in the future to make it more dynamic as this first stage was done in 4 hours.

## To install the plugin:
Extract the repo and save it inside <YOUR VAULT>/.obsedian/plugins/llm_summary


## To make it work:
Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens and generate a token
Then paste this token inside the settings of the plugin (inside Obsidian settings)

## To try it: 
Select a text, then right click and press on 'Falcon Summarizer', which will generate a summary for the selected text
